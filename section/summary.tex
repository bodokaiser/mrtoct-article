\section{Summary and outlook}

We outline in detail the preprocessing steps necessary to prepare a public
available dataset for the task of \gls{mri} to \gls{ct} translation.
Furtheremore we provide a reference implementation of different state of the
art models and compare obtained statistics and visual results. We believe
that the lack of sufficient (public) data is still a major holdback to this
specific computer vision task, which, however can be circumvented to a degree
through the input of more domain knowledge.
