\section{Introduction}

\gls{ct} and \gls{mri} are the main workhorses of todays clinical diagnosis
and cancer monitoring by revealing the inner organ conditions without surgery.
Inside the clinical framework \gls{mri} is the more informative and safer
modality~\cite{Hartwig09}. Instead of x-rays which are known to possess the
risk of provoking cancer inside the patient~\cite{Martin06}, \gls{mri} exploit
the magnetic properties of hydrogen nucleus and are not associated with any
health risks. Additionally \gls{mri} provides a much higher soft tissue. These
benefitial characteristics suggest that \gls{mri} supersdes \gls{ct} in the
long-term. One of many remaining obstacles is, however, the requirement of
\gls{ct} for image guided radiation therapy planning. Although \gls{mri} and
\gls{ct} differ significant in the applied physics, the high entropy inside
\gls{mri} data suggests the existence of a one directional mapping from
\gls{mri} to \gls{ct} space. With the recent advent of computer vision
techniques based on \gls{gan} we seem to close to find such a mapping.
