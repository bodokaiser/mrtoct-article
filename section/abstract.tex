\begin{abstract}
  We present a detailed description and reference implementation of
  preprocessing steps necessary to prepare the public \gls{rire} dataset
  for the task of \gls{mri} to \gls{ct} translation. Furthermore we describe
  and implement three state of the art \gls{cnn} and \gls{gan} models where
  we report statistics and visual results of two of them.
